# RNA-seq analysis of *P. astreoides* reciprocal transplantation experiment

The analysis of the transcriptional response following the *in situ* reciprocal transplantation of *P. astreoides* colonies between shallow and mesophotic reefs.

### Samples
To analyze the transcriptional response of *P. astreoides*, we sequenced 31 samples belonging to different time points and depths. In summary, we had 6 replicates of deep (D) and 6 replicates of shallow (S) colonies before translocation (T0), 5 replicates of translocated colonies: deep &rarr; deep (DD), deep &rarr; shallow (DS) and shallow &rarr; shallow (SS), and 4 replicates of shallow &rarr; deep (SD) translocated colonies. Paired 150-bp reads were obtained using Illumina platform.
