The recent devastating impacts of global warming and local stressors on shallow-water coral reef communities are expected to increase as oceans continue to warm, leading to more frequent and severe bleaching-induced mortality events (e.g.(Hughes et al. 2017). In recent years, deeper reef systems, termed Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems (MCEs), have gained considerable interest as they may be buffered from several of the local and global impacts affecting shallow-water coral reefs, such as increased sea surface temperature and associated bleaching. In fact, although not immune to the impacts of climate change(Smith et al. 2016a), MCEs have not experienced the same trend in coral decline as their shallow water counterparts, displaying relatively stable coral populations over time(Bak et al. 2005a). It is hypothesized, therefore, that MCEs may serve as an important refuge for coral species, thereby increasing overall reef resilience(Glynn 1996; Bongaerts et al. 2010a).  
Resilience of ecosystems under rapid environmental change relies, in part, on the capacity of organisms to adapt and/or acclimatize to new conditions. Several species that exist along a broad depth distribution have been shown to differ in skeletal morphology at different depths ((Bruno and Edmunds 1997; Einbinder et al. 2009; Goodbody-Gringley et al. 2015; Goodbody-Gringley and Waletich 2018). Likewise, changes in the coral’s diet towards a more heterotrophic form of nutrition with lower calcification and photosynthesis rates were reported over increasing depth (Mass et al. 2007; Einbinder et al. 2009). These variations are often suggested to result from morphological plasticity in response to differing environmental conditions at depth, such as low light intensity (e.g. (Goodbody-Gringley and Waletich 2018). Yet, variation can also result from selection, but the relative influence of acclimatization compared to adaptation on morphology and physiology remains unclear. 

### In the research proposed here, we will examine the mechanisms that enable corals to thrive across broad vertical gradients, to determine if differential patterns in morphology and physiology are a result of plasticity or evolutionary adaptation

### Hypothesis 
Corals will adapt to new conditions via changes in morphology (macro and micro skeletal morphology), physiology (nutrient acquisition, fluorescence, symbiotic associations, and metabolic processes) and gene expression. 

We conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment at Little Cayman in two locations: Martha’s finyard and Coral city. In both locations, 10 colonies of PAST were collected at 10 and 40 m in November 27-28th 2022. The Corals were cut in half and stained with Alizarin Red 1% mix 1 gr in 100ml for 4-5h
